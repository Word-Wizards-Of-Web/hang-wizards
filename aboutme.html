            Meet Anthony, the coding maestro of Seattle who's more fluent in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML than he is in ordering his morning coffee. When he's not busy deciphering the mysteries of web development, you can find him caught in the eternal struggle between choosing his favorite sports team and conquering the latest video game level. Rumor has it that Anthony once wrote a function so efficient that it scored a touchdown and defeated a boss simultaneously. Seattle's tech scene has never been the same since Anthony rolled into town, armed with a laptop and a passion for coding that rivals his love for a well-executed slam dunk or a perfectly timed headshot. Watch out, Silicon Valley ‚Äì Anthony's in the house, and he's coding circles around the competition while perfecting his victory dance.

            Hello, I'm Negin, a 32-year-old trailblazer with a story shaped by resilience and relentless pursuit of dreams.

            üåê At 18, I ventured to Malaysia for higher education. At 21, my family and I immigrated to the U.S., where I navigated banking while pursuing education part-time.
            
            üéñÔ∏è After five years in banking, I enlisted in the U.S. Army for three years, facing challenges with unwavering determination.
            
            üíª Now, I'm transitioning into software development, driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to pushing boundaries.
            
            üìú My journey is a testament to adaptability, resilience, and an ever-evolving pursuit of dreams. Excited for the endless possibilities ahead.
